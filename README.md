# Investigating Microlensing Effects on Ringdown Tests of General Relativity
## overview
This Git repository contains the code and documentation for a research project focused on investigating the effects of microlensing in ringdown tests of general relativity. 
## structure 
The main parts of this repository is:
lal_bbh_ jframe_np.py -  compute the fisher matrix using J-Frame parameters for an IMRPhenom in GWbench/Wf_models
microlensed_np.py - compute the fisher matrix for a microlensed waveform in GWbench/Wf_models
ringdown_np.py - compute the fisher matrix for a damped sinusoids ringdown waveform in GWbench/Wf_models
